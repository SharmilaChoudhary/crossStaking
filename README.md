CrossChain Staking App
Developed a robust cross-chain staking platform, enabling users to seamlessly stake GHO tokens on various blockchain networks through Chainlink integration. Implemented a token bridging mechanism, allowing GHO tokens to traverse different chains effortlessly. The platform also features ConnectKit integration for a user-friendly "Connect Wallet" button, ensuring a smooth connection between the dApp and users' wallets. Furthermore, Solidity smart contracts have been deployed to execute secure and transparent staking operations, enhancing the overall reliability of the platform.
